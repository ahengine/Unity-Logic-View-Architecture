# Unity Logic View Architecture
 To implement this sample of Logic-View Architct, I used these self-made packages: UScreens, UPatterns, UHTTP



I designed an architectural pattern that I called View-Logic Architecture

When you have a module like Leaderboard and your module has two sides.

- User interface side
- Logic and API side

This architect pattern helps you write a clean and SOLID implementation of your module
